# OTPPDataLoaderProject
This tracks the OTPPDataLoader Project which is meant to take data from the following two sources:

https://www.alphavantage.co

https://finnhub.io/

It uses a server client architecture to try and create a signal generator that could be used to invest on.

This currently requires you to set up a conda environment and run the scripts from that environment.

The starting commands are as follows
<code>python server.py -h </code>
<code>python client.py -h </code>
